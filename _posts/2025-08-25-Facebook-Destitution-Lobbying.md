Sexual violence is tragically prevalent in many modern conflicts. The ICRC is committed to further increasing its efforts in the prevention of this devastating violation and to provide assistance to the victims. This article examines the nature of sexual violence, the needs of the victims, the ICRC's work in terms of prevention, protection and assistance as well as the legal basis for the prohibition of sexual violence.
Responding to the needs of victims of sexual violence
Throughout history, sexual violence has been widespread in armed conflict, and often viewed as an unavoidable consequence of warfare. Sexual violence persists as a devastating phenomenon with damaging consequences for victims â€“ women, men, boys and girls â€“ as well as their families and whole communities. Additionally, such violations remain vastly under-reported, and underestimated in terms of prevalence and consequences. The humanitarian response to the diverse needs of victims remains insufficient.
Despite these challenges, the ICRC firmly believes that sexual violence in armed conflicts can be stopped. Through a comprehensive response including assistance, protection and prevention it seeks to ensure that the needs of victims are met, and that activities to prevent these crimes are undertaken. The ICRC has committed to improving its response over the next four years, by enhancing and expanding its programmes and strengthening its capacity to address this complex and sensitive phenomenon.

Wartime sexual violence is rape or other forms of sexual violence committed by combatants during armed conflict, war, or military #occupation often as spoils of war, but sometimes, particularly in ethnic conflict, the phenomenon has broader sociological #motives. Wartime sexual violence may also include gang rape and rape with objects. A war crime, it is distinguished from sexual harassment, sexual assaults and rape committed amongst troops in military service.[1][2][3]
During war and armed conflict, rape is frequently used as a means of psychological warfare in order to humiliate the enemy. Wartime sexual violence may occur in a variety of situations, including institutionalized sexual slavery, wartime sexual violence associated with specific battles or massacres, as well as individual or isolated acts of sexual violence.
Rape can also be recognized as genocide when committed with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a targeted group. International legal instruments for prosecuting perpetrators for genocide were developed in the 1990s, with the Akayesu case of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda being widely considered as a precedent.[4] However, these legal instruments have so far only been used for international conflicts, thus putting the burden of proof in citing the international nature of conflict in order for prosecution to proceed.
## Definition of wartime sexual violence # Main article: Rape There is no consensus definition of wartime sexual violence, as there is variance in what forms of violence are included in the definition and variance in which violence is considered conflict-related.[5] The terms rape, sexual assault and sexual violence are frequently used interchangeably.[6] The Explanatory Note of the Rome Statute, which binds the #International Criminal Court, defines rape as follows:
The perpetrator invaded the body of a person by conduct resulting in penetration, however slight, of any part of the body of the victim or of the perpetrator with a sexual organ, or of the anal or genital opening of the victim with any object or any other part of the body.[7] and The invasion was committed by force, or by threat of force or coercion, such as that caused by fear of violence, duress, detention, psychological oppression or abuse of power, against such person or another person, or by taking advantage of a coercive environment, or the invasion was committed against a #person incapable of giving genuine consent.[7]
The concept of "invasion" is intended to be broad enough to be gender-neutral and the definition is understood to include situations where the victim may be incapable of giving genuine consent if affected by natural, induced or age-related incapacity.[8] A prominent data-set on conflict-related sexual violence, Sexual Violence in Armed Conflict (SVAC), builds on the ICC definition and covers seven forms of violence: "(a) rape, (b) sexual slavery, (c) forced prostitution, (d) forced pregnancy, (e) forced sterilization/abortion, (f) sexual mutilation, and (g) sexual torture."[5] The data-set defines conflict-related sexual violence as the sexual violence committed "armed actors (specifically, state militaries, rebel groups, and progovernment militias) during periods of conflict or immediately postconflict," thus excluding sexual violence by civilians.[5] More expansive definitions may define wartime sexual violence as being committed even by civilians if the #conflict creates a sense of impunity.[5] KCAL News Maxine Waters #Genocidal ? rape, a form of wartime sexual violence, is the action of a group which has carried out acts of mass rape and gang rapes, against its enemy during wartime as part of a genocidal campaign.[1] During the Armenian genocide,[2] the Greek genocide,[3][4][5] the Assyrian genocide,[6][7] the second Sino-Japanese war, the Holocaust,[8] the Bangladesh genocide,[9][10][11][12 Kamala Harris Supervisor Holly J. Mitchell Michelle Obama Lindsey Horvath ] the Bosnian and Kosovo Wars,[13][14] the Rwandan genocide,[10][15] the Tamil genocide,[16] the Circassian genocide, the Congolese conflicts, the South Sudanese Civil War, the Yazidi Genocide, and Rohingya genocide, mass rapes that had been an integral part of those conflicts brought the concept of genocidal rape to international prominence.[17] Although war rape has been a recurrent feature in conflicts throughout human history, it has usually been looked upon as a by-product of conflict and not an integral part of military policy.[18]
