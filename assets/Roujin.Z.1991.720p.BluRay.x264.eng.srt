1
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:27,970
Haruko!

2
00:00:36,647 --> 00:00:42,695
Haruko! I wet bed.

3
00:00:49,995 --> 00:00:53,999
I feel awful,

4
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:57,962
Haruko.

5
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:05,179
Just a decade after its creation,

6
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:06,889
the Medical Crisis Network

7
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,183
is already overloaded.

8
00:01:09,225 --> 00:01:10,434
We destribute Medical Alert pendants

9
00:01:10,476 --> 00:01:13,605
to the chronically ill,

10
00:01:13,647 --> 00:01:16,316
such as heart patients and the elderly.

11
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:18,819
We've given out seven million pendants!

12
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:21,406
The nursing homes

13
00:01:21,447 --> 00:01:23,032
are filled to capacity,

14
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,743
and they can't afford modern equipment.

15
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:28,496
We're also experiencing shortages

16
00:01:28,538 --> 00:01:30,582
in home staff.

17
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,919
There aren't enough nurses,
and their salaries are skyrocketing.

18
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:37,506
Excuse me.

19
00:01:40,802 --> 00:01:42,429
I have a solution to

20
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:46,099
all the problems of the elderly!

21
00:01:46,141 --> 00:01:49,103
This will revolutionize medicine!

22
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:50,521
I have a blueprint for a new society,

23
00:01:50,855 --> 00:01:53,149
respecting the elderly.

24
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:54,985
Within a single decade

25
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:58,113
we can eliminate all of our problems

26
00:01:58,155 --> 00:02:01,032
and grant the elderly a rich, full life!

27
00:02:01,032 --> 00:02:03,286
And to cap this magnificent

28
00:02:03,327 --> 00:02:05,204
dream we already have funding,

29
00:02:05,246 --> 00:02:07,540
the Ministry of Public Welfare...

30
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,876
has been given...

31
00:02:09,917 --> 00:02:11,711
the greatest project of this century!

32
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,881
This is our task.

33
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:15,841
I present you

34
00:02:15,883 --> 00:02:18,510
the most important work of our era,

35
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:20,137
a project that

36
00:02:20,179 --> 00:02:23,975
will reconcile the young

37
00:02:24,017 --> 00:02:26,186
and old.

38
00:02:29,356 --> 00:02:30,608
The solution is...

39
00:02:30,649 --> 00:02:31,567
here!

40
00:03:34,178 --> 00:03:35,972
You can't do that, Mr.Takazawa.

41
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:39,768
You can't use the alert pendant,
just because you wet yourself.

42
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:44,231
Dr.Misaka was really upset...

43
00:03:44,272 --> 00:03:47,735
when you pushed it
in the middle of the night last week.

44
00:03:59,248 --> 00:03:59,915
Get off him!

45
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,333
You're only supposed to use

46
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,460
the pendant

47
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,213
in an emergency!

48
00:04:13,806 --> 00:04:16,100
That sounds close.

49
00:04:27,989 --> 00:04:28,573
I'm coming!

50
00:04:31,534 --> 00:04:32,326
I'm coming.

51
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:36,582
I...

52
00:04:39,543 --> 00:04:40,919
This is the man.

53
00:04:40,961 --> 00:04:43,630
Mr.Takazawa! You pushed it again!

54
00:04:43,672 --> 00:04:44,966
Who are you?

55
00:04:45,008 --> 00:04:46,259
I'm Haruko Mihashi,

56
00:04:46,301 --> 00:04:48,178
a student nurse.

57
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,054
I'm his volunteer nurse.

58
00:04:50,054 --> 00:04:51,055
Sorry!

59
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,557
He used it again, didn't he?

60
00:04:52,557 --> 00:04:54,477
I keep telling him...

61
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:56,562
Mr. Kijuro Takazawa,

62
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,397
you're coming with us.

63
00:05:00,107 --> 00:05:02,569
What's going on?

64
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:04,863
He's going to assist us.

65
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:07,908
We're with
the Ministry of Public Welfare.

66
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,119
Ministry of Public Walfare?

67
00:05:10,161 --> 00:05:12,163
His family has granted permission.

68
00:05:12,205 --> 00:05:14,248
Haruko!

69
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,791
Mr.Takazawa!

70
00:05:20,964 --> 00:05:22,591
Umm... excuse me,

71
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:24,134
but where are you taking him?

72
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:43,072
...and that's how the body

73
00:05:43,113 --> 00:05:46,243
absorbs the nutrients from food.

74
00:05:46,284 --> 00:05:48,912
This entire process takes about 24 hours.

75
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,873
Then the food is excreted as waste.

76
00:05:54,752 --> 00:05:57,630
Next week, we'll pick up with the anus.

77
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,848
Haruko!

78
00:06:07,182 --> 00:06:10,395
I finally got tickets to Ink Stick!

79
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:11,938
Let's go!

80
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:13,982
Did you hear?
-What?

81
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,153
Dr.Tachibana got a letter

82
00:06:18,153 --> 00:06:20,030
from the Ministry of Public Welfare.

83
00:06:20,072 --> 00:06:22,157
The Ministry?

84
00:06:22,157 --> 00:06:25,244
They've made a breakthrough
in nursing equipment.

85
00:06:25,285 --> 00:06:27,622
They're going to
test it on Kijuro Takazawa.

86
00:06:28,999 --> 00:06:30,917
This band is hot!

87
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:33,628
Their concert will be recorded live!

88
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:36,507
What kind of nursing equipment?

89
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:38,467
I don't know.

90
00:06:38,509 --> 00:06:40,344
The press conference is

91
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:42,430
at 3:00 today

92
00:06:42,471 --> 00:06:44,683
in the welfare center.
-3:00?

93
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:47,352
It's almost 3:00 now!

94
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:07,458
Our society is being crushed

95
00:07:07,499 --> 00:07:09,919
under a growing problem...

96
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:11,963
the problem of the elderly.

97
00:07:12,005 --> 00:07:15,717
How far are we willing to go to

98
00:07:15,717 --> 00:07:17,720
preserve our nation's elders?

99
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:22,016
Everywhere we turn,
there are painful choices to be made.

100
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:24,685
But now an answer screams out:

101
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,564
The Z-001!

102
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:32,068
It's a priceless addition
to any hospital.

103
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,070
Yet, this new invention

104
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:36,240
will prove most useful

105
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:40,077
in the home.

106
00:07:40,077 --> 00:07:41,704
See for yourselves.

107
00:07:52,091 --> 00:07:53,760
An ultrasonic bath will clean every pore

108
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,846
of the patients body!

109
00:08:01,143 --> 00:08:05,064
The bathing schedule
can be pre-programmed.

110
00:08:05,147 --> 00:08:06,857
The bed senses humidity and perspiration

111
00:08:06,899 --> 00:08:08,443
and will adjust the temperture

112
00:08:08,443 --> 00:08:10,153
and frequency

113
00:08:10,195 --> 00:08:12,280
of baths.

114
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,790
Excretion!

115
00:08:20,873 --> 00:08:22,750
An elderly person's

116
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,086
most embarrassing problem!

117
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:27,631
This problem terrifies

118
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,633
even the most devoted family.

119
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:32,636
But our machine
has eliminated this problem!

120
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,223
If the system

121
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,516
detects a faint oder,

122
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:40,895
an extension automatically
vacuums waste from the patient.

123
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:42,481
The crisis is over before

124
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:45,818
an invalid could call for assistance.

125
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,028
Dignity is maintained.

126
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:49,822
No mess, no embarrassment.

127
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:52,367
The bedridden often have

128
00:08:52,409 --> 00:08:54,953
a surplus of leisure time.

129
00:08:54,995 --> 00:08:58,957
So naturally, our machine provides
sample entertainment.

130
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:01,502
The bed includes HI-FI stereo, radio,

131
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:03,546
TV and phone-modules.

132
00:09:03,587 --> 00:09:06,090
Patients can buy or sell stock,

133
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,718
they can watch races or follow sports.

134
00:09:07,759 --> 00:09:09,344
They can even go shopping

135
00:09:09,344 --> 00:09:12,597
around the world!

136
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,850
There are programs for chess, Go, Othello

137
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,477
and video games.

138
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:18,980
A word processor

139
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:20,106
helps writing haiku

140
00:09:20,148 --> 00:09:21,316
and poetry.

141
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:23,860
A patient can even call up

142
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:26,363
his friends in their own Z-001 beds.

143
00:09:26,363 --> 00:09:28,866
And if there are no friends,

144
00:09:28,907 --> 00:09:30,492
just input an image and personality.

145
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:33,955
The computer will provide...

146
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:37,208
a simulation conversation partner.

147
00:09:39,961 --> 00:09:41,421
But there's more!

148
00:09:41,463 --> 00:09:43,049
A built-in feeding station!

149
00:09:49,013 --> 00:09:51,266
The Z-001 holds food for a week,

150
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,810
including dessert!

151
00:09:53,852 --> 00:09:55,812
Patients can download

152
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:58,941
their favorite recipes.

153
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:05,823
And after eating,

154
00:10:05,865 --> 00:10:07,701
what could be better

155
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:09,828
than a little exercise?

156
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:17,420
It's important to stretch first,
especially the back.

157
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:19,756
Patients can walk or row.

158
00:10:19,798 --> 00:10:24,553
Then can even swim in the bathwater.

159
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,939
But that's still not all!

160
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:35,649
The Z-001 is a perfect analysis station.

161
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,984
It monitors

162
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:40,612
blood pressure,

163
00:10:40,612 --> 00:10:42,782
breathing, heart rate and EEG.

164
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:45,618
And if any of these vital signs

165
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:47,620
should become

166
00:10:47,662 --> 00:10:49,372
abnormal,

167
00:10:49,413 --> 00:10:51,500
the computer can provide an

168
00:10:51,542 --> 00:10:53,293
instant diagnosis.

169
00:10:53,293 --> 00:10:56,421
If a medical history has been input,

170
00:10:56,463 --> 00:10:58,883
the bed can even prescribe a treatment

171
00:10:58,925 --> 00:11:01,803
such as oxygen.

172
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:04,931
Or if the situation is more serious,

173
00:11:04,973 --> 00:11:07,935
the bed will connect to the local datanet.

174
00:11:07,977 --> 00:11:09,311
The bed can sent out a call,

175
00:11:09,311 --> 00:11:13,983
alerting the family doctor,
hospital or other institutions.

176
00:11:17,404 --> 00:11:19,823
It can even handle disasters,

177
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:22,951
such as an earthquake,

178
00:11:22,993 --> 00:11:25,830
typhoon or robbery!

179
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:30,293
But that means...

180
00:11:30,334 --> 00:11:33,714
Exactly! A sixth-generation computer!

181
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,844
It has self-enhancement capabilities.

182
00:11:38,885 --> 00:11:41,264
It exceeds the learning abilities

183
00:11:41,306 --> 00:11:43,975
of fifth-generation systems.

184
00:11:44,017 --> 00:11:46,185
It can even upgrade its own hardware.

185
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:48,313
It is truly a dream computer.

186
00:11:49,273 --> 00:11:50,941
Excuse me!

187
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:52,860
What powers it?

188
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:57,449
Nuclear power. A miniature atomic furnace.

189
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,825
What if

190
00:11:58,867 --> 00:12:00,327
there's a radiation leak?

191
00:12:00,368 --> 00:12:03,079
Don't worry, there's a

192
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:06,167
built-in supersensitive alarm.

193
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,585
It's completely safe.

194
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:10,338
It really is safe, isn't it!

195
00:12:10,421 --> 00:12:12,131
Wait a minute!

196
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:17,054
I'm sure it's a wonderful machine,

197
00:12:17,054 --> 00:12:21,058
but look at Mr.Takazawa, just lying there.

198
00:12:21,099 --> 00:12:23,061
I feel sorry for him.

199
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,937
How can a machine

200
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:27,565
give him the love he needs?

201
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:31,235
I remember you.

202
00:12:31,277 --> 00:12:33,906
I'm Mr.Takazawa's...

203
00:12:33,906 --> 00:12:35,282
You're right!

204
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:37,910
Nothing can replace the love of a family.

205
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,373
But we can help that family,
as much as possible.

206
00:12:41,456 --> 00:12:45,001
We want to give the elderly a rich,
full life!

207
00:12:45,043 --> 00:12:47,337
That's our dream.

208
00:12:47,379 --> 00:12:48,756
That is why we at the
Ministry of Public Welfare...

209
00:12:48,756 --> 00:12:53,260
lovingly present

210
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:55,638
the Z-001!

211
00:13:01,478 --> 00:13:02,562
Terada!

212
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:08,027
The Secretary of Public Welfare is here!

213
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:58,125
Geriattrics has sure come a long way.

214
00:13:58,167 --> 00:14:01,128
But they
shouldn't dump people in machines.

215
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,964
That just hides the problem.

216
00:14:04,006 --> 00:14:06,509
Yeah, it doesn't feel right.

217
00:14:08,011 --> 00:14:09,804
But we shouldn't have to

218
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:13,601
devote our whole lives to old people.

219
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:15,978
The geezers probably agree.

220
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,897
You're so selfish!

221
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,902
Life is more than just lying in bed.

222
00:14:21,943 --> 00:14:22,986
Haruko!

223
00:14:23,528 --> 00:14:25,488
How did the announcement go?

224
00:14:25,989 --> 00:14:30,035
Stop it! The experimental
subject was Haruko's patient.

225
00:14:30,076 --> 00:14:32,496
That must have been a shock.

226
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,507
On my computer?

227
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:55,814
I thought you'd left it turned on,

228
00:14:55,856 --> 00:14:58,192
but it's on every channel.

229
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,702
It's a message from someone,

230
00:15:07,744 --> 00:15:09,704
but what a way to send it!

231
00:15:09,746 --> 00:15:12,667
I guess you got the message, right Haruko?

232
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:14,710
You're giving me the creeps.

233
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:19,507
Wait, I have to get a printout!

234
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:21,218
I'll get a cable.

235
00:15:21,259 --> 00:15:22,636
How come?

236
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:24,137
Just gathering evidence.

237
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:53,503
Tomoe?

238
00:15:53,545 --> 00:15:54,963
What's going on here?

239
00:16:07,185 --> 00:16:10,313
What happened?
Are they broken?

240
00:16:11,314 --> 00:16:12,567
I didn't do it!

241
00:16:12,608 --> 00:16:15,236
Don't be so defensive!

242
00:16:17,321 --> 00:16:18,197
Mr.Takazawa!

243
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,295
Maybe you're right, but still,

244
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:32,672
let's think about this

245
00:16:32,672 --> 00:16:35,008
before we get too carried away.

246
00:16:35,008 --> 00:16:36,634
What a worm!

247
00:16:36,676 --> 00:16:38,721
You're just scared.

248
00:16:38,762 --> 00:16:41,807
Right. We got an SOS,

249
00:16:41,849 --> 00:16:44,185
so we're coming to help.

250
00:16:58,868 --> 00:17:01,162
Nobuko, I need a light here!

251
00:17:07,044 --> 00:17:09,046
Figured it out?

252
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:11,925
Are you kidding? Look at this thing!

253
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,220
Come on, let's go.

254
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,680
What if we get caught?

255
00:17:18,097 --> 00:17:20,392
You are so spineless!

256
00:17:22,019 --> 00:17:24,188
What's the big deal?!

257
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,024
He's just an old man!

258
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:30,070
I can't abandon him!

259
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:34,407
After all, we have a solemn duty...

260
00:17:34,574 --> 00:17:36,284
as nursing volunteers!

261
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,710
Haruko, was it?

262
00:17:46,797 --> 00:17:48,966
What are you doing here?

263
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:50,759
This is a government facility.

264
00:17:50,759 --> 00:17:53,720
that is closed to the public.

265
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:57,058
Mr.Takazawa was calling for help!

266
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,060
Calling for help?

267
00:17:59,102 --> 00:18:02,523
He sent a message to
my computer this afternoon.

268
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:08,821
Get out of here.

269
00:18:16,579 --> 00:18:20,001
There is evidence of
a message being transmitted.

270
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,379
Thank you!

271
00:18:23,421 --> 00:18:25,339
Now that you've informed us,

272
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:27,299
we can solve the problem.

273
00:18:27,341 --> 00:18:30,220
Excellent work!

274
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:32,222
Really?

275
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:34,516
Haruko, that's great!

276
00:18:35,934 --> 00:18:38,146
Thank God! I was afraid

277
00:18:38,187 --> 00:18:39,897
we'd be arrested!

278
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:41,941
But what about Mr.Takazawa?

279
00:18:41,983 --> 00:18:43,526
He'll be fine now.

280
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:44,527
Hasegawa!

281
00:18:44,652 --> 00:18:46,989
Yes. I'll call the supervising physician.

282
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,660
Hasegawa is here...
-Haruko, let's go home.

283
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,663
Satisfied?

284
00:18:53,705 --> 00:18:55,165
They'll take care of it.

285
00:18:55,206 --> 00:18:59,377
This will take a while,
so you might as well go home.

286
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:01,337
I'll see you to the door.

287
00:19:02,381 --> 00:19:04,800
Yes, that's right.

288
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:11,516
Haruko.

289
00:19:12,768 --> 00:19:16,438
Help me!
-What's going on?

290
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,525
But I turned off
the autonomous calculation circuits.

291
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:21,527
Mr.Takazawa!

292
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,826
You fool!
-Haruko!

293
00:19:27,868 --> 00:19:30,496
Mr.Takazawa is calling for help.

294
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:34,041
You can't do that!
Probes are wired into his trachea

295
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:37,045
and nervous system.

296
00:19:37,045 --> 00:19:39,547
Pulling it off could kill him!

297
00:19:39,547 --> 00:19:41,549
That's terrible!

298
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:44,386
We have his family's permission.

299
00:19:44,428 --> 00:19:47,556
Do you have his permission?

300
00:19:47,556 --> 00:19:50,184
I'll call the project leader.

301
00:19:50,226 --> 00:19:51,727
Fiend!
Monster!

302
00:19:51,727 --> 00:19:54,898
Elder abuse!
Let him go!

303
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:56,733
Get out of here!

304
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,985
You kids don't know anything!

305
00:20:05,826 --> 00:20:07,828
Yes, send the police, please.

306
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:14,753
Mr.Terada!

307
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,344
Haruko.

308
00:20:21,886 --> 00:20:24,013
Let's go home.

309
00:20:24,055 --> 00:20:26,057
Yes Mr.Takazawa, let's go home!

310
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,521
Stop!

311
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:39,531
Mr.Terada!

312
00:20:47,665 --> 00:20:50,668
What are we going to do now?

313
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:57,843
You idiots!

314
00:20:58,844 --> 00:21:02,473
That bed is too big for anything

315
00:21:02,515 --> 00:21:04,142
but a freight elevator.

316
00:21:09,398 --> 00:21:10,232
Let's go!

317
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:22,370
Hey, wait! Open up!

318
00:21:22,412 --> 00:21:24,122
Haruko!

319
00:21:29,003 --> 00:21:30,296
Did you see that?

320
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:40,390
What are we going to do with him?

321
00:21:40,432 --> 00:21:43,853
We have to get this story to the media!

322
00:21:45,354 --> 00:21:50,151
Haru, let's go home.

323
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:52,780
Yes, this is Terada.

324
00:21:52,821 --> 00:21:54,531
Give me Secretary Minagawa.

325
00:21:54,990 --> 00:21:58,035
I'm sorry to disturb you
in the middle of the night.

326
00:21:58,035 --> 00:21:58,535
Yes.

327
00:22:09,882 --> 00:22:10,883
Haruko!

328
00:22:11,342 --> 00:22:12,635
The bed's coming up.

329
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,308
Quiet!

330
00:22:23,146 --> 00:22:24,439
I'm home.

331
00:22:24,481 --> 00:22:26,901
Mr.Takazawa! We can't stay.

332
00:22:26,943 --> 00:22:30,321
I just came to get your wife's picture.

333
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:35,452
The police!

334
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:40,749
What's going on?

335
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,542
Out of the way!

336
00:22:46,422 --> 00:22:47,632
That rat!

337
00:22:49,509 --> 00:22:52,263
That guy's here too.
-Terada?

338
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:55,432
They're going to arrest us!

339
00:22:55,432 --> 00:22:57,768
Maybe they'll go easy on us

340
00:22:57,768 --> 00:23:01,189
if we surrender!

341
00:23:01,231 --> 00:23:03,942
Do you see any TV crews?

342
00:23:03,984 --> 00:23:06,194
Oh no! My mother will find out!

343
00:23:06,236 --> 00:23:07,612
I have to tell them

344
00:23:07,612 --> 00:23:09,574
about the bed before we're arrested!

345
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,045
Stop it!

346
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:23,255
I need to show

347
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:25,049
the TV crews--

348
00:23:25,091 --> 00:23:27,677
What are you going to tell them?

349
00:23:27,719 --> 00:23:30,805
Were you going to
give out your friends' names?

350
00:23:31,681 --> 00:23:33,726
But officer, please--

351
00:23:33,767 --> 00:23:35,477
Ouch!
Stop pulling!

352
00:23:35,519 --> 00:23:36,937
Mr.Takazawa!

353
00:23:42,527 --> 00:23:43,570
Hasegawa!

354
00:23:50,995 --> 00:23:51,537
Get up.

355
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:14,520
I can't begin to
express how disappointed l am.

356
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,898
We were all so proud

357
00:24:15,939 --> 00:24:17,816
of this project.

358
00:24:17,858 --> 00:24:21,528
I expect you to
take full responsibility for this,

359
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:22,863
Terada.

360
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,366
I'm sorry.

361
00:24:24,366 --> 00:24:26,201
But there was more

362
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:31,581
to this than merely
inputting faulty data.

363
00:24:31,623 --> 00:24:34,210
Where in the blueprints

364
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:37,088
does it mention a transforming bed?

365
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:41,635
That was a feature
in case of natural disaster.

366
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:47,057
We weren't properly informed
about this new computer.

367
00:24:48,558 --> 00:24:50,937
Where has the black box gone?

368
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:53,189
Where did we get the money

369
00:24:53,272 --> 00:24:55,983
for a sixth generation computer?

370
00:24:56,025 --> 00:24:59,905
The computer was donated by
the Nishibashi Corporation.

371
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:02,574
We never received complete readings

372
00:25:03,158 --> 00:25:05,577
about the computer.

373
00:25:07,747 --> 00:25:12,377
How can we evaluate a machine
that we don't even understand?

374
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:16,590
Is that true?

375
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:17,591
Hasegawa?

376
00:25:19,301 --> 00:25:20,594
Hasegawa!

377
00:25:23,264 --> 00:25:24,641
Damn it!

378
00:25:24,683 --> 00:25:27,853
Don't mess
with the Ministry of Public Welfare!

379
00:25:27,894 --> 00:25:29,563
Can I borrow your phone?

380
00:25:31,189 --> 00:25:34,277
This is Hasegawa. Yeah.

381
00:25:36,571 --> 00:25:37,822
Just a second.

382
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,995
This is Minagawa.

383
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:46,373
Hello.
Yes, this is Minagawa.

384
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:47,165
What?

385
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:50,962
Yes, sir! Not at all.

386
00:25:50,962 --> 00:25:52,255
No sir.

387
00:25:52,297 --> 00:25:54,299
I'm sorry, sir.

388
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:55,592
Right, right.

389
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,678
I didn't know.

390
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,554
Yes.

391
00:26:38,890 --> 00:26:40,517
Honey!

392
00:26:46,565 --> 00:26:49,319
Haru...

393
00:26:54,658 --> 00:26:58,663
For now, you'll do
all your work here in the ward.

394
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:02,208
You're getting off very lightly.

395
00:27:04,752 --> 00:27:06,880
Well, you have work to do.

396
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,090
Yes, sir!

397
00:27:20,812 --> 00:27:22,731
Three whole hours!

398
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:25,984
The prof yelled at us
for three whole hours!

399
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,989
it was terrible. He kept blaming us!

400
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:33,868
At least it's over.

401
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:35,745
No one got expelled or arrested.

402
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:37,914
Let's just forget about it.

403
00:27:40,251 --> 00:27:45,381
Haruko, are you still worried about him?

404
00:27:45,464 --> 00:27:48,385
There's nothing else we can do.

405
00:27:48,427 --> 00:27:51,805
I hope this doesn't appear in our grades.

406
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:54,266
We got an SOS.

407
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,517
And we

408
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,770
did everything we could.

409
00:27:57,812 --> 00:28:01,440
They promised to fix the bed.

410
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,526
Besides, there's plenty of other old men

411
00:28:03,568 --> 00:28:05,112
who look just like him.

412
00:28:05,154 --> 00:28:06,822
It's just that

413
00:28:06,864 --> 00:28:09,533
he's always been my patient,

414
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:11,869
since I first volunteered.

415
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,162
You're too attached to him.

416
00:28:13,203 --> 00:28:14,998
Hey, you!

417
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,333
No talking in the halls.

418
00:28:17,375 --> 00:28:18,668
Yeah, Yeah.

419
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:20,795
I still have work to do.

420
00:28:20,837 --> 00:28:22,756
Aren't you coming with us?

421
00:28:22,798 --> 00:28:24,383
We'll be

422
00:28:24,425 --> 00:28:27,553
at the karaoke bar.

423
00:28:27,595 --> 00:28:29,013
See you there!

424
00:28:59,172 --> 00:29:02,508
All right! I'm in!

425
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:05,012
Great!

426
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:10,351
What a stupid password!

427
00:29:10,392 --> 00:29:12,144
With my ALGOL program

428
00:29:12,186 --> 00:29:15,357
it was like taking candy from a baby.

429
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:20,779
Hey, miss! Did you see that?

430
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,198
Is it a game?

431
00:29:22,239 --> 00:29:26,035
I just broke into
the Tyrell Corporation in America.

432
00:29:26,077 --> 00:29:28,579
I found evidence of tax evasion.

433
00:29:30,874 --> 00:29:33,168
Tax evasion?

434
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:34,503
We're going to

435
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:37,297
anonymously send this data

436
00:29:37,339 --> 00:29:38,508
to a newspaper.

437
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:41,511
Of course, it's legally inadmissible.

438
00:29:41,552 --> 00:29:43,012
Still, I bet the paperst

439
00:29:43,054 --> 00:29:45,682
will be interested in it.

440
00:29:45,723 --> 00:29:50,729
Cracking a system is such a rush!

441
00:29:50,729 --> 00:29:52,898
My stiff neek is gone.

442
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,360
and I've got a massive hard-on!

443
00:29:55,402 --> 00:29:57,904
You old pervert!

444
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:02,575
Are you serious?

445
00:30:05,454 --> 00:30:06,539
You bet I am!

446
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:09,834
Wanna see?

447
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:14,089
No, not that!
I'm talking about the computer!

448
00:30:14,089 --> 00:30:15,465
What?

449
00:30:15,507 --> 00:30:18,176
Are you calling me a liar?

450
00:30:19,302 --> 00:30:21,389
Then it is true?

451
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:22,932
Of course!

452
00:30:22,974 --> 00:30:26,269
I'm the best hacker this side of Hakone.

453
00:30:26,269 --> 00:30:28,646
That's because you can't go outside.

454
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,111
I have a huge favor to ask you.

455
00:30:38,324 --> 00:30:40,034
On to the next bar!

456
00:30:43,872 --> 00:30:46,375
Here are your drinks.

457
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:49,336
Coming right up.

458
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,297
Waiter!

459
00:30:52,756 --> 00:30:55,719
Why does she keep talking about...

460
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,762
that stupid old man all the time?

461
00:30:59,556 --> 00:31:02,809
She dumped you, didn't she?

462
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,104
Shut up.

463
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:11,194
Haruko's grandma...

464
00:31:11,235 --> 00:31:12,905
You're the grandma?

465
00:31:12,946 --> 00:31:15,199
In eighth grade,

466
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,451
Haruko's parents gave her a study room.

467
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:20,955
They gave
Haruko her grandmother's old room.

468
00:31:20,997 --> 00:31:25,502
Haruko was thrilled to get the room.

469
00:31:25,543 --> 00:31:28,379
But then her grandma died...

470
00:31:28,421 --> 00:31:30,257
alone and unloved in a rest home.

471
00:31:32,051 --> 00:31:33,636
Hey, you guys.

472
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,597
No more sob stories.

473
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,309
Go sing, Nobuko!

474
00:31:39,351 --> 00:31:40,644
Are you okay?

475
00:31:40,685 --> 00:31:44,522
Come on, Nobuko!
-Try it!

476
00:31:44,522 --> 00:31:48,527
I guess I have to.

477
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:55,452
Waiter! I want some mackerel

478
00:31:55,494 --> 00:31:57,621
and a beer!
-Right away!

479
00:31:58,205 --> 00:32:01,124
The world is such a lonely place.

480
00:32:01,667 --> 00:32:03,962
Why are you so gloomy,

481
00:32:04,003 --> 00:32:06,047
Maeda?

482
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:30,741
This is tough.

483
00:32:35,663 --> 00:32:38,083
All right, a challenge!

484
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:39,459
I see...

485
00:32:39,501 --> 00:32:41,753
Let me help.

486
00:32:43,755 --> 00:32:45,591
Okay.

487
00:32:45,591 --> 00:32:48,594
It would speed things up
if we work in parallel.

488
00:32:48,636 --> 00:32:49,679
I'm sorry.

489
00:32:49,721 --> 00:32:53,182
But I'm really worried about Mr.Takazawa.

490
00:32:53,224 --> 00:32:55,019
If I could just talk to him,

491
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,646
I could find out if he's okay.

492
00:32:57,688 --> 00:33:01,066
You must be keen
to meet this old geezer!

493
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:02,277
You old fool!

494
00:33:02,318 --> 00:33:05,405
I'm not doing it
for that rotting old carcass!

495
00:33:05,447 --> 00:33:07,907
I knew it. You want the girl.

496
00:33:07,949 --> 00:33:09,784
You pervert!

497
00:33:09,784 --> 00:33:12,955
I want to see...

498
00:33:12,997 --> 00:33:16,584
what a sixth-generation computer
looks like.

499
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,952
I did it!
-Really?

500
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:54,251
Though...

501
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:56,170
What is it?

502
00:33:56,212 --> 00:33:59,256
I'm sending signals,

503
00:33:59,298 --> 00:34:00,633
but there's no response.

504
00:34:00,674 --> 00:34:01,927
Sounds dead.

505
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,888
The computer!

506
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:09,017
Our data should be getting through.

507
00:34:09,017 --> 00:34:10,520
Maybe

508
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,897
we're locked out.

509
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:16,984
This young lady says

510
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:20,531
she knows the guy.

511
00:34:20,531 --> 00:34:22,950
Try calling him.

512
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:25,410
What's his name?

513
00:34:54,151 --> 00:34:57,029
It's no use.

514
00:34:57,071 --> 00:34:59,532
There must be a password.

515
00:34:59,573 --> 00:35:01,326
We'll have to find it.

516
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,414
Maybe...

517
00:35:05,414 --> 00:35:06,248
What?

518
00:35:41,746 --> 00:35:44,291
Could you duplicate this person's voice?

519
00:36:05,689 --> 00:36:07,066
Mr.Takazawa.

520
00:36:22,708 --> 00:36:25,544
Mr. Takazawa, are you in pain?

521
00:36:25,669 --> 00:36:27,506
It's you!

522
00:36:28,006 --> 00:36:30,550
You came for me!

523
00:36:30,675 --> 00:36:32,677
Of course, Mr.Takazawa.

524
00:36:34,179 --> 00:36:36,641
Who is it! Who's there?
This area's restricted.

525
00:36:37,683 --> 00:36:40,770
Mr.Takazawa, are you all right?

526
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,647
Are you in pain?

527
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:46,735
It hurts!

528
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:48,654
Help me!

529
00:36:50,197 --> 00:36:51,866
You poor, poor man.

530
00:36:51,908 --> 00:36:56,621
They've been so cruel to you.

531
00:36:58,456 --> 00:37:00,626
Somebody help!

532
00:37:05,297 --> 00:37:07,216
Just hold on.

533
00:37:07,258 --> 00:37:10,262
I'm going to help you.

534
00:37:11,263 --> 00:37:13,348
He's in pain.

535
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,642
We have to save him.

536
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,689
Learned anything about

537
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:22,149
the sixth-generation computer?

538
00:37:23,109 --> 00:37:25,195
This is incredible!

539
00:37:25,237 --> 00:37:26,905
I've seen three-dimensional

540
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:30,409
architecture before.

541
00:37:30,450 --> 00:37:33,078
But there's something completely unique

542
00:37:33,078 --> 00:37:37,250
down at the core.

543
00:37:37,250 --> 00:37:40,253
It must be a bio-computer.

544
00:37:40,295 --> 00:37:42,673
Bio-computer?

545
00:37:42,715 --> 00:37:44,717
It's made from bio-chips.

546
00:37:44,758 --> 00:37:48,387
Slimy little blobs of living matter.

547
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:50,890
These are not made in Japan.

548
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,767
Then this was built...

549
00:37:52,767 --> 00:37:59,275
Everyone's working on it,
but the only success was at...

550
00:37:59,275 --> 00:38:00,651
the Pentagon!

551
00:38:01,402 --> 00:38:03,654
The American military!

552
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,490
But that means...

553
00:38:06,532 --> 00:38:09,786
Wait! You kids always go off half-cocked.

554
00:38:09,828 --> 00:38:13,790
Know your enemy, know yourself
and you'll win every battle.

555
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:24,762
Mr.Terada.

556
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,263
You're late!

557
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:29,558
I'm sorry.
What about the bed?

558
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:32,519
I don't know.
We'll find out when we see it.

559
00:38:36,358 --> 00:38:37,984
All of you!

560
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:39,486
Get back to work!

561
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:57,506
What's happening?

562
00:39:06,224 --> 00:39:08,477
We got it to stand up.

563
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:12,147
What a fascinating computer!

564
00:39:12,189 --> 00:39:13,816
Old age keeps getting better!

565
00:39:13,857 --> 00:39:15,777
What are you doing now?

566
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:18,488
Once a baby stands, a parent

567
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,198
can get it to walk.

568
00:39:53,110 --> 00:39:56,572
What's happening?
Stop it! Find the switch!

569
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:57,656
Impossible!

570
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,679
Damn, what the hell is going on?

571
00:40:45,668 --> 00:40:46,669
It's that girl!

572
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:50,174
She must be controlling it!

573
00:40:51,216 --> 00:40:51,884
Follow me.

574
00:40:56,639 --> 00:40:57,724
Mom, look!

575
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,379
My shop...!

576
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,220
It stopped!

577
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,471
Haruko!

578
00:42:11,097 --> 00:42:14,226
What are you doing here?

579
00:42:14,268 --> 00:42:16,228
I have to go!

580
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,855
Nokoku, take care of the things here!

581
00:42:17,896 --> 00:42:19,231
Haruko!

582
00:42:19,231 --> 00:42:24,779
Where should we go, honey?

583
00:42:25,822 --> 00:42:29,200
Did you hear that?
-Someone was talking!

584
00:42:29,242 --> 00:42:31,662
Where should we go?

585
00:42:31,704 --> 00:42:33,205
It's the computer.

586
00:42:34,999 --> 00:42:37,376
The computer has taken on a personality!

587
00:42:37,418 --> 00:42:39,713
It's evolving!

588
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,090
Kamakura.

589
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:52,560
This special bulletin has just come in.

590
00:42:52,602 --> 00:42:54,770
This morning at 9:00 a.m.

591
00:42:54,770 --> 00:42:56,940
an unidentified robot...

592
00:42:56,982 --> 00:42:57,691
Ah?

593
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:01,445
An unidentified robot

594
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,072
terrorized shoppers
in the Kanto district.

595
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:06,159
This sounds like science fiction.

596
00:43:06,201 --> 00:43:07,869
A reporter is on the scene.

597
00:43:07,911 --> 00:43:09,829
We take you there now.

598
00:43:09,871 --> 00:43:11,789
Miss Sakata?

599
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:14,251
I'm at the scene of a bizarre crime.

600
00:43:14,293 --> 00:43:16,754
You can see the destruction

601
00:43:16,795 --> 00:43:18,672
everywhere around me.

602
00:43:18,714 --> 00:43:22,052
No one knows where this mysterious robot

603
00:43:22,093 --> 00:43:24,179
came from.

604
00:43:24,971 --> 00:43:27,307
Hey, look at this!

605
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:31,479
What? I think I'm going to puke!

606
00:43:50,166 --> 00:43:52,377
Damn it! I knew this was the place!

607
00:43:52,877 --> 00:43:54,087
Hey, nice system!

608
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:57,383
Has anybody

609
00:43:57,424 --> 00:43:59,468
seen that girl?

610
00:43:59,510 --> 00:44:01,512
This is a hospital!
Please keep it down!

611
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:06,351
Where is she?

612
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:07,936
Hey, you!

613
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,772
Yoshio!

614
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,817
Yoshie!

615
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,530
Damn it!
Let's go, Hasegawa!

616
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,326
This is a hospital!
Please keep it down!

617
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:25,872
Come back to me, Yoshie!

618
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:28,375
Ouch!

619
00:44:47,230 --> 00:44:49,733
The air is thick with tension...

620
00:44:57,575 --> 00:44:58,492
Here it comes.

621
00:45:03,038 --> 00:45:05,917
It has added quite a few parts.

622
00:45:07,461 --> 00:45:08,920
Okay. Begin the operation!

623
00:45:09,629 --> 00:45:10,714
Move everyone into position.

624
00:45:23,729 --> 00:45:24,730
Proceed.

625
00:45:30,445 --> 00:45:33,281
Please minimize the damage.

626
00:45:33,281 --> 00:45:35,116
Headquarters has already told us

627
00:45:35,116 --> 00:45:36,576
not to hurt the man inside.

628
00:45:36,618 --> 00:45:37,953
So, don't worry.

629
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:41,207
Actually, I want you to protect
the machine. It's very valuable.

630
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:57,767
Just a little further.

631
00:45:57,808 --> 00:46:00,394
Are the men from Nishibashi ready?

632
00:46:00,436 --> 00:46:01,771
Stop!

633
00:46:01,812 --> 00:46:05,776
No! You'll hurt him!
-It's her! Grab her!

634
00:46:05,817 --> 00:46:06,777
Arrest her!

635
00:46:17,956 --> 00:46:19,207
Let go of me!

636
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,085
Mr.Takazawa!

637
00:46:21,126 --> 00:46:22,836
What are you doing?

638
00:46:23,003 --> 00:46:25,005
Release that girl at once!

639
00:46:26,674 --> 00:46:27,716
Who said that?

640
00:46:44,443 --> 00:46:45,696
Stop the robot!

641
00:47:26,073 --> 00:47:27,742
Are you all right?

642
00:47:28,118 --> 00:47:30,912
Yes, I'm fine.
How's Mr.Takazawa?

643
00:47:30,912 --> 00:47:34,499
He's fine.
He has finally fallen asleep.

644
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:35,751
That voice!

645
00:47:36,419 --> 00:47:38,921
Well, if you'll excuse me...

646
00:47:51,602 --> 00:47:52,519
After it!

647
00:47:57,776 --> 00:48:00,737
Let me go! Hey!

648
00:48:02,281 --> 00:48:04,617
You've ruined our project

649
00:48:04,617 --> 00:48:06,368
and the hope of this nation's elderly!

650
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:08,746
I'm sorry, I did what I had to do.

651
00:48:09,622 --> 00:48:11,541
Mr.Terada, we have to catch it!

652
00:48:11,583 --> 00:48:12,876
Hurry!

653
00:48:12,918 --> 00:48:15,295
You'll take full responsibility for this!

654
00:48:15,337 --> 00:48:17,047
Haruko!

655
00:48:18,173 --> 00:48:19,091
What?

656
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:23,721
Get him!

657
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:32,731
Got you!

658
00:48:33,315 --> 00:48:34,149
Maeda!

659
00:48:35,692 --> 00:48:37,153
Haruko!

660
00:48:37,904 --> 00:48:39,948
Hang in there, Maeda!

661
00:48:41,991 --> 00:48:43,743
Wait...

662
00:48:50,167 --> 00:48:52,169
Where is it heading?
-Towards Kanagawa.

663
00:48:52,211 --> 00:48:54,464
Excuse me, could you scoot over?

664
00:48:54,506 --> 00:48:56,007
Oh, sure.

665
00:48:56,007 --> 00:48:57,217
Hasegawa, move over.

666
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:01,012
It's you! What are you doing here?

667
00:49:01,054 --> 00:49:01,931
Get out!

668
00:49:10,649 --> 00:49:12,943
Send us a news helicopter!

669
00:49:12,985 --> 00:49:14,319
Call H.Q.!

670
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:16,196
I want a shot of this!

671
00:49:16,238 --> 00:49:17,489
Pardon me.

672
00:49:19,534 --> 00:49:21,703
That robot is a personal friend.

673
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,044
You've got some nerve!

674
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:31,213
Conceited little college co-ed!

675
00:49:31,213 --> 00:49:34,550
No one can stop the Z-001 now!

676
00:49:34,592 --> 00:49:36,219
It's grown too powerful!

677
00:49:37,220 --> 00:49:39,139
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

678
00:49:39,889 --> 00:49:41,182
I never expected

679
00:49:41,224 --> 00:49:43,601
such a radical transformation.

680
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:46,272
This is beyond everyone's expectations!

681
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:49,608
You were just using the Ministry!

682
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:52,571
Secretary Minagawa
has been fully informed!

683
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:53,238
Damn!

684
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:56,074
Are you saying that the nursing bed...

685
00:49:56,074 --> 00:49:58,035
The computer is the problem.

686
00:49:58,076 --> 00:50:00,579
The bed was just a ploy.

687
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:06,336
I wasn't lying. My company is
planning to sell a nursing bed.

688
00:50:06,377 --> 00:50:08,504
But it was a perfect test for

689
00:50:08,546 --> 00:50:11,008
our new muitipurpose computer.

690
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:11,967
It was a military project!

691
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,177
A military project!

692
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,637
You told me you cared about the elderly!

693
00:50:15,763 --> 00:50:17,348
You lied to me!

694
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:21,478
I didn't dare to tell you
that it was a weapons test.

695
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,687
Message from the ground...

696
00:50:22,729 --> 00:50:24,397
They've lost the target.

697
00:50:24,439 --> 00:50:25,690
What?

698
00:50:25,732 --> 00:50:26,692
It's all right.

699
00:50:30,029 --> 00:50:31,947
I know where it's going.

700
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,079
What's wrong, Nobuko?

701
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,247
Where's Haruko?

702
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:42,042
Help me with the patients.

703
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:43,294
Where's Haruko?

704
00:50:43,336 --> 00:50:45,296
Kamakura!
-Kamakura?

705
00:50:45,296 --> 00:50:46,547
Kamakura?

706
00:50:48,466 --> 00:50:51,260
I'm sure that's where
Takazawa wants to go.

707
00:50:51,302 --> 00:50:53,764
The bed now has a personality based on

708
00:50:53,806 --> 00:50:56,058
Takazawa's memories.

709
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,769
I'm looking at
his psychological profile right now.

710
00:50:59,812 --> 00:51:01,147
Mr.Takazawa!

711
00:51:05,151 --> 00:51:07,570
What is it doing up there?

712
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:09,657
How did it manage that?

713
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:11,033
After it! Hurry!

714
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:19,751
God!

715
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:21,670
It's using the monorail track!

716
00:51:29,345 --> 00:51:31,973
Mr.Takazawa!

717
00:51:46,447 --> 00:51:48,741
Stop! This is very dangerous!

718
00:51:48,867 --> 00:51:50,368
Get down from there!

719
00:51:51,036 --> 00:51:52,746
Take us closer!

720
00:51:53,706 --> 00:51:56,000
I said this is too dangerous!

721
00:51:56,041 --> 00:51:58,002
Pull over, now!

722
00:51:59,921 --> 00:52:00,755
Mr.Takazawa!

723
00:52:05,093 --> 00:52:06,761
Mr.Takazawa!

724
00:52:07,053 --> 00:52:09,724
You idiot! You'll get yourself killed!

725
00:52:09,765 --> 00:52:11,475
Let me go!

726
00:52:11,517 --> 00:52:13,227
You pervert!

727
00:52:13,895 --> 00:52:17,107
Be quiet!
-No, just leave it in the container.

728
00:52:17,149 --> 00:52:18,525
I want you to bring it.

729
00:52:18,567 --> 00:52:20,819
The Secretary has given permission.

730
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:26,576
Mr.Terada.

731
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:35,377
Let me down!

732
00:52:40,758 --> 00:52:42,886
We can't keep flying this low.

733
00:52:42,927 --> 00:52:44,054
Then fly on ahead!

734
00:52:44,137 --> 00:52:45,639
What about Mr.Terada?

735
00:52:47,182 --> 00:52:48,975
Wait, Hasegawa!

736
00:52:49,017 --> 00:52:49,768
Wait!

737
00:52:59,738 --> 00:53:01,448
This is too dangerous!

738
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,283
Calm down, Mr.Terada.

739
00:53:03,283 --> 00:53:04,951
Your blood pressure is rising.

740
00:53:04,951 --> 00:53:06,036
Who said that?

741
00:53:06,078 --> 00:53:06,870
The old man?

742
00:53:06,912 --> 00:53:11,084
Your blood pressure is up to 197.
Your pulse rate is 130.

743
00:53:11,292 --> 00:53:13,795
Too much excitement
could strain your heart!

744
00:53:16,215 --> 00:53:17,674
Who are you?

745
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:19,093
The computer?

746
00:53:19,134 --> 00:53:22,012
I'm Takazawa's wife. Haru.

747
00:53:22,054 --> 00:53:22,638
What?

748
00:53:22,763 --> 00:53:23,764
Ah!

749
00:53:26,810 --> 00:53:27,977
Are you all right!

750
00:53:27,977 --> 00:53:29,229
Let me go,

751
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:31,773
you overgrown calculator!

752
00:53:31,815 --> 00:53:33,109
Take me back to the Ministry!

753
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:36,862
You're the people
who put my husband in such pain.

754
00:53:36,904 --> 00:53:40,533
Try to understand how we elderly feel.

755
00:53:40,574 --> 00:53:43,870
But this project was
intended to help the elderly!

756
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:45,789
And now you've ruined it!
-Enough!

757
00:53:46,748 --> 00:53:48,834
A nurse is useless

758
00:53:48,834 --> 00:53:50,336
unless she can love her patient.

759
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:52,422
But...

760
00:53:52,797 --> 00:53:56,092
My husband
just wants to go to the beach.

761
00:53:56,134 --> 00:53:57,677
So sit back and be quiet.

762
00:53:59,388 --> 00:54:01,181
But there's a news blackout!

763
00:54:01,181 --> 00:54:03,016
I don't care!

764
00:54:03,016 --> 00:54:05,269
Just keep filming!

765
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,520
Going where?

766
00:54:06,562 --> 00:54:08,022
Yui Beach?

767
00:54:08,064 --> 00:54:10,859
In Kamakura?

768
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,152
Some of our patients

769
00:54:12,235 --> 00:54:14,779
have a computer link to the bed.

770
00:54:15,364 --> 00:54:17,199
You owe me now.

771
00:54:26,334 --> 00:54:27,377
Haru!

772
00:54:27,419 --> 00:54:29,880
I sympathize with what you're saying,

773
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:32,258
but won't you please turn back?

774
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:36,304
This project has its faults,

775
00:54:36,345 --> 00:54:39,765
but it will benefit the elderly.

776
00:54:41,768 --> 00:54:45,772
Please turn back for their sake.

777
00:54:46,523 --> 00:54:47,399
Please!

778
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:49,527
Haru.

779
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:51,070
Will you let my husband

780
00:54:51,112 --> 00:54:53,156
see the beach first?

781
00:54:53,198 --> 00:54:54,782
Will you come back afterwards?

782
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:56,367
I promise.

783
00:54:57,243 --> 00:54:59,079
You will?

784
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:00,080
Thank you!

785
00:55:13,094 --> 00:55:14,387
It's coming.

786
00:55:14,889 --> 00:55:16,766
Good. Bring the truck around front.

787
00:55:16,891 --> 00:55:18,267
Bring the truck around.

788
00:55:28,195 --> 00:55:28,862
There it is!

789
00:55:33,451 --> 00:55:34,577
Hold on a minute.

790
00:55:37,956 --> 00:55:40,041
Mr.Terada, you're alive!

791
00:55:40,083 --> 00:55:41,543
Take down the barricade!

792
00:55:41,585 --> 00:55:42,336
Ah?

793
00:55:42,378 --> 00:55:44,463
This bed is going to

794
00:55:44,463 --> 00:55:46,548
Yui Beach!

795
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:48,425
What are you talking about?

796
00:55:48,467 --> 00:55:50,887
I made a promise to the computer.

797
00:55:50,929 --> 00:55:51,763
After we visit the beach,

798
00:55:51,846 --> 00:55:54,140
she'll come back. Hurry up!

799
00:55:57,018 --> 00:56:00,022
Move back, everyone. Open the road.

800
00:56:02,149 --> 00:56:03,734
Bring out the Alpha.

801
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:13,787
Hasegawa?

802
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,623
What is this?

803
00:56:15,665 --> 00:56:17,709
This is a combat version of the z-001.

804
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:21,254
It has no prior programming,.

805
00:56:21,295 --> 00:56:23,966
so it will follow our orders.

806
00:56:24,007 --> 00:56:24,883
Damn you!

807
00:56:24,925 --> 00:56:26,885
What are you doing?

808
00:56:26,927 --> 00:56:28,345
We're going to crush it.

809
00:56:28,345 --> 00:56:29,388
What?

810
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:30,848
Mr.Terada,

811
00:56:30,848 --> 00:56:35,186
how can you make a promise
to a defective computer?

812
00:56:35,186 --> 00:56:39,190
Besides, we can't ignore the
destruction it's causing.

813
00:56:43,404 --> 00:56:45,698
Would you please move aside?

814
00:56:45,698 --> 00:56:48,368
No, Mr.Takazawa! Stay back!

815
00:56:51,663 --> 00:56:54,166
Stop! Mr.Takazawa's in there!

816
00:56:55,208 --> 00:56:57,211
Mr.Takazawa, get away!

817
00:57:06,972 --> 00:57:08,348
Go, bed!

818
00:57:08,390 --> 00:57:10,976
No one messes with
the Ministry of Public Welfare!

819
00:57:14,606 --> 00:57:17,567
Idiots! The Alpha has the same computer

820
00:57:17,609 --> 00:57:20,612
in a combat frame.

821
00:57:31,249 --> 00:57:32,584
Mr.Takazawa!

822
00:57:32,626 --> 00:57:34,628
I told you to fix it!

823
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:36,838
That cord goes over here!

824
00:57:48,143 --> 00:57:49,770
Can you hear me, miss?

825
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:51,813
Why aren't you at the beach yet?

826
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:54,441
She looks like she's in trouble.

827
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:56,903
The robot!
Mr.Takazawa!

828
00:57:56,945 --> 00:57:59,155
Look like she found her friend.

829
00:57:59,197 --> 00:58:02,450
Haruko, Maeda is on

830
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:03,660
his way!

831
00:58:08,916 --> 00:58:10,459
Haruko!

832
00:58:12,127 --> 00:58:14,839
I thought we ordered a news blackout.

833
00:58:14,881 --> 00:58:16,132
Hurry up

834
00:58:16,132 --> 00:58:18,343
and crush that pile of junk!

835
00:58:49,837 --> 00:58:51,213
Don't go! It's too dangerous!

836
00:58:55,175 --> 00:58:58,013
Doesn't human life mean anything to you?

837
00:58:58,013 --> 00:59:00,515
Control that monster of yours.

838
00:59:00,557 --> 00:59:02,183
You're getting old yourself.

839
00:59:02,225 --> 00:59:04,145
You'll be ready for a bed soon..

840
00:59:04,186 --> 00:59:06,605
Just stand back and let me work.

841
00:59:18,994 --> 00:59:20,579
Haru!

842
00:59:20,620 --> 00:59:21,539
The beach

843
00:59:21,581 --> 00:59:24,417
is on the other side of this tunnel!

844
00:59:29,631 --> 00:59:31,717
Almost there!

845
00:59:48,402 --> 00:59:50,321
It's falling apart! Get back!

846
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:51,906
But Mr.Takazawa's in there!

847
00:59:51,906 --> 00:59:52,823
Mr.Takazawa...

848
01:00:07,256 --> 01:00:09,258
Transformed!

849
01:00:21,856 --> 01:00:24,609
Haru, I'm hungry.

850
01:00:24,651 --> 01:00:28,238
I have my hands full right now.
Please wait a moment, darling.

851
01:00:37,081 --> 01:00:38,166
What happened?

852
01:00:38,208 --> 01:00:40,627
It's disaster!
We've lost our link to the Alpha!

853
01:00:40,669 --> 01:00:42,170
What!?

854
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,985
What happened to Haruko?

855
01:01:40,027 --> 01:01:41,737
Do something!

856
01:01:41,778 --> 01:01:43,113
You don't know what you're asking!

857
01:01:43,155 --> 01:01:45,491
There's a war in there!

858
01:01:46,326 --> 01:01:48,369
I'll be killed if I go in!

859
01:01:50,038 --> 01:01:52,290
Geez, what a wimp!

860
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:53,834
Be a man!

861
01:01:55,794 --> 01:01:58,797
Hey, Mister White Knight!

862
01:01:58,839 --> 01:02:01,091
You know, a woman loves to be rescued.

863
01:02:16,150 --> 01:02:17,026
Haruko!

864
01:02:17,693 --> 01:02:20,530
Please take care of my husband.

865
01:02:21,114 --> 01:02:22,032
Ah?

866
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:31,334
Mr.Takazawa...

867
01:02:35,630 --> 01:02:38,258
My wife..

868
01:02:48,228 --> 01:02:49,312
Mrs.Takazawa!

869
01:02:50,313 --> 01:02:52,524
Haruko!

870
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:55,402
Hurry! We have to get out of here!

871
01:02:55,444 --> 01:02:56,320
No!

872
01:02:59,865 --> 01:03:01,701
I'm here to rescue you, Haruko!

873
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:04,162
Follow that robot!

874
01:03:05,413 --> 01:03:07,833
The beach is so close!

875
01:03:07,874 --> 01:03:09,543
We have to catch up to her!

876
01:03:48,587 --> 01:03:49,629
Mrs.Takazawa!

877
01:04:00,474 --> 01:04:01,226
Damn!

878
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:09,360
Mrs.Takazawa!

879
01:04:09,736 --> 01:04:10,862
Mommy!

880
01:04:11,446 --> 01:04:12,822
I'm hungry...

881
01:04:13,197 --> 01:04:14,574
We have to get out.

882
01:04:19,204 --> 01:04:20,331
The picture!

883
01:04:20,372 --> 01:04:22,458
What's happening to Haruko?

884
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:23,834
Quiet!

885
01:04:24,126 --> 01:04:25,044
Got it!

886
01:04:26,086 --> 01:04:27,339
Are you online?

887
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,094
Stop! Stop!

888
01:04:36,557 --> 01:04:38,351
Can you hear me?

889
01:04:38,392 --> 01:04:39,810
Smash the core chip!

890
01:04:39,852 --> 01:04:43,607
The only way to kill it
is to break its head!

891
01:04:43,648 --> 01:04:45,233
Where is it?

892
01:04:45,233 --> 01:04:47,778
It keeps shifting!

893
01:04:52,241 --> 01:04:53,868
It's the left rear right now.

894
01:04:53,910 --> 01:04:55,453
We'll direct you.

895
01:04:55,495 --> 01:04:56,621
Hurry!

896
01:04:56,662 --> 01:04:59,832
But how can I break it?

897
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,836
Use this! Hurry!

898
01:05:04,254 --> 01:05:05,464
An oxygen tank?

899
01:05:05,964 --> 01:05:07,841
Maeda! Give me a hand!

900
01:05:11,096 --> 01:05:12,472
Hurry! Go!

901
01:05:16,267 --> 01:05:17,269
What's happening?

902
01:05:18,938 --> 01:05:19,855
Hurry...

903
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,071
It's out of control.

904
01:05:26,154 --> 01:05:27,072
Let's get out of here!

905
01:05:48,137 --> 01:05:49,847
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

906
01:05:48,846 --> 01:05:49,847
Stop!

907
01:06:03,028 --> 01:06:04,155
Stop!

908
01:06:28,056 --> 01:06:30,434
Where is the core chip?

909
01:06:30,475 --> 01:06:31,852
Where is it?

910
01:06:31,852 --> 01:06:34,564
It's on the upper left side.
Can you see it?

911
01:06:34,856 --> 01:06:38,151
That fool!
You idiot!

912
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:40,862
Honey, I'll get you

913
01:06:40,904 --> 01:06:42,071
to the beach.

914
01:06:44,241 --> 01:06:45,951
Haru...

915
01:06:46,660 --> 01:06:49,663
No one messes with the
Ministry of public Welfare!

916
01:06:55,629 --> 01:06:57,339
No!

917
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,381
Don't!

918
01:07:09,811 --> 01:07:12,856
Don't do it!

919
01:07:13,398 --> 01:07:15,067
We're going to the beach!

920
01:07:25,746 --> 01:07:27,164
Mrs.Takazawa, help!

921
01:08:29,984 --> 01:08:31,277
I'm hungry.

922
01:08:36,116 --> 01:08:38,535
Wow, what a show!

923
01:08:55,929 --> 01:08:58,057
Hey, it's still collapsing.

924
01:09:01,978 --> 01:09:01,895
Mrs.Takazawa!

925
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:17,871
Mrs.Takazawa!

926
01:09:18,622 --> 01:09:20,749
Mrs.Takazawa...

927
01:09:20,790 --> 01:09:21,875
Mrs.Takazawa!

928
01:09:22,334 --> 01:09:23,376
Haruko,

929
01:09:23,669 --> 01:09:25,171
where's my husband?

930
01:09:26,297 --> 01:09:28,674
Haru!

931
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:34,264
Ah, honey.

932
01:09:34,890 --> 01:09:36,391
I can't go on.

933
01:09:39,394 --> 01:09:42,899
Haru...

934
01:09:45,068 --> 01:09:51,575
But we'll be together again...

935
01:09:51,617 --> 01:09:52,868
soon...

936
01:09:54,411 --> 01:09:55,871
Haru...

937
01:09:57,624 --> 01:09:58,667
Mr.Takazawa.

938
01:09:59,584 --> 01:10:00,669
Yes.

939
01:10:00,752 --> 01:10:02,879
We'll be together again soon.

940
01:10:03,213 --> 01:10:05,883
Hold on, Mr.Takazawa.

941
01:10:06,884 --> 01:10:07,885
Mr.Takazawa, he...

942
01:10:09,762 --> 01:10:12,682
He's a little weak, but he's fine.

943
01:10:12,723 --> 01:10:13,891
He'll be okay.

944
01:10:15,268 --> 01:10:16,103
Mr.Takazawa...

945
01:10:40,213 --> 01:10:42,674
The damage was caused

946
01:10:42,674 --> 01:10:44,843
during the testing of a
new geriatric-care ambulance.

947
01:10:44,884 --> 01:10:47,011
The Ministry of Public Welfare...

948
01:10:47,053 --> 01:10:49,807
Yoshihiko Hasegawa has been arrested

949
01:10:49,849 --> 01:10:55,688
following the accident.

950
01:10:55,688 --> 01:10:58,066
Hasegawa is a developer

951
01:10:58,108 --> 01:10:59,526
at the Nishibashi Corporation.

952
01:10:59,526 --> 01:11:00,736
Hasegawa is charged

953
01:11:00,777 --> 01:11:02,821
with delivering a defective computer...

954
01:11:02,863 --> 01:11:08,161
Which was
used onboard the runway ambulance.

955
01:11:08,202 --> 01:11:10,079
Nishibashi shipments.. have been halted.

956
01:11:10,121 --> 01:11:14,418
Pending investigation.

957
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,588
That sure stirred them up!

958
01:11:18,380 --> 01:11:20,841
Good work, men.

959
01:11:20,883 --> 01:11:22,927
But our job is done.

960
01:11:22,969 --> 01:11:26,890
Those lying weasels
covered it up pretty well.

961
01:11:28,558 --> 01:11:30,895
The Bad Sleep Well.

962
01:11:39,779 --> 01:11:41,406
Mr.Terada.

963
01:11:41,448 --> 01:11:44,201
Could you answer a question?

964
01:11:44,242 --> 01:11:45,702
We'd like a statement!

965
01:11:46,077 --> 01:11:49,081
Secretary Minagawa will
answer all questions.

966
01:11:49,665 --> 01:11:52,877
As I said
in yesterday's press conference...

967
01:11:54,295 --> 01:11:55,588
Was there an old man?

968
01:11:55,588 --> 01:11:57,382
inside the ambulance?

969
01:11:57,382 --> 01:11:58,592
Say something!

970
01:11:58,592 --> 01:12:01,345
Was the old man

971
01:12:01,386 --> 01:12:05,016
a guinea pig in a military weapons test?

972
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:08,770
An anonymous source has
provided some interesting files.

973
01:12:08,811 --> 01:12:09,938
Is that true?

974
01:12:09,979 --> 01:12:13,609
How could an ambulance
cause so much damage?

975
01:12:13,609 --> 01:12:14,902
What's really going on?

976
01:12:15,402 --> 01:12:16,487
I'm sure

977
01:12:16,529 --> 01:12:19,782
everything will be made clear in court.

978
01:12:19,823 --> 01:12:24,120
However, this project is still intended

979
01:12:24,162 --> 01:12:26,539
to benefit the public.

980
01:12:26,581 --> 01:12:28,583
Although our first attempt
had problems we'll fix them.

981
01:12:28,625 --> 01:12:32,046
I regret that our announcement

982
01:12:32,088 --> 01:12:33,965
made such rumors possible.

983
01:12:34,006 --> 01:12:34,799
That's all I have to say.

984
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,343
One moment, Mr.Terada.

985
01:12:48,982 --> 01:12:50,316
Let's go

986
01:12:50,358 --> 01:12:51,985
see him.

987
01:13:06,001 --> 01:13:07,711
Are you awake? Mr.Takazawa.

988
01:13:08,336 --> 01:13:10,422
I'm just bringing flowers today.

989
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:12,257
I'll be back soon.

990
01:13:12,298 --> 01:13:15,177
Go to the beach...

991
01:13:15,219 --> 01:13:16,887
You sure did go to the beach.

992
01:13:17,888 --> 01:13:20,975
You often took your wife there.

993
01:13:21,017 --> 01:13:24,688
She'll come for me soon.

994
01:13:24,688 --> 01:13:27,190
Don't say things like that.

995
01:13:27,190 --> 01:13:29,902
You have to think about getting better.

996
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,864
Once you're better
we'll go back to the beach.

997
01:13:32,989 --> 01:13:34,198
I'm...

998
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,702
going to the beach.

999
01:13:37,744 --> 01:13:39,913
Yes, so you...

1000
01:13:41,248 --> 01:13:42,124
An earthquake?

1001
01:13:58,517 --> 01:14:00,102
She came for me.

1002
01:14:08,361 --> 01:14:10,614
I've come for you.

1003
01:14:19,415 --> 01:14:20,918
Haru!

1004
01:14:21,919 --> 01:14:28,300
It took me a while...
to get used to this new body.

1005
01:14:29,260 --> 01:14:33,097
Shall we go to the beach,

1006
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:34,432
honey?
